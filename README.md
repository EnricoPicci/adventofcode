# Advent of Code -  Solutions
All the solutions (except day 4), can be run via node command or copying the code to browser console.
like

`
node 01.js
`

Day 4 solution use 'require' and hence works only with node.

##Notes
1. Your inputs may differ.
2. Day 15, takes bit longer to compute all the combinations.
3. Most of the samples use ES6 and functional features of JavaScript, and they can be improved further.
For any suggestions, bugs feel free to ping me [@bhosaleajay](https://twitter.com/bhosaleajay) or send a pull request. 

##Lessons Learned
1. Read the instructions carefully. I wasted most of the time, just because I didn't read the instructions properly.
2. If the site is not accepting your answer for Part II, then it may possible that there is bug with Part I implementation (even if, it is giving a perfect answer).
